# Stockbird

Stockbird will find you stocks to invest and tells you when to invest on them as I do in real life.

	My goal is to gather information about the stock
	(first by hand, later with integrations)

first:

   - stock price integration for timing
	 - top price in a year, lowest price in a year
	 - Results dates (dates when it is possible that stock will fly)

later

	- Notify from stock price crash

integration:

	- divident and divident pay date
	- PE-Ratio (Price per earnings)
	- comparing the investment possibilities
	- simplywall.st (what should be the price of the stock based on analytics)
	- finder (what could the direction of the stock in general)
	- information what other have bought?

buy hand:

	- kauppalehti (what people think about the stock)
	- bloomberg (latest news)
