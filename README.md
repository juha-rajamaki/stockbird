# Stockbird

Stockbird will find you stocks to invest and tells you when to invest on them as I do in real life.

	My goal is to gather information about the stock
	(first by hand, later with integrations)

first:

   - stock price integration for timing

integration:

	- comparing the investment possibilities
	- divident
	- simplywall.st (what should be the price of the stock based on analytics)
	- finder (what could the direction of the stock in general)

buy hand:

	- kauppalehti (what people think about the stock)
	- bloomberg (latest news)
